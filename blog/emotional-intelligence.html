      <h2><em>So what exactly is EQ (Emotional Intelligence)</em></h2><br>
    <div class="text">
      <p>EQ can be described as the understanding and awareness of both self and others. It is different from IQ - which evaluates one's personal intellect based on their ability to problem solve,
        wherein EQ is the effect in which we connect with ourselves and others in an emotional level - to understand how people are feeling. If there are situations that occur in which heightened emotions are at play,
        we are able to succesfully navigate our way in managing such emotions and finding ways to deal with the emotions. This can be achieved via learning and cultivating our neuroplasticity in order to better manage thoughts and emotions through three differing methods.</p>
      <p>The first method of which is mindfulness practice. It entails meditation to calm the mind and be able to judge predicaments without conscious bias. This allows us to have better decision-making skills surrounding our individual circumstances and how best to navigate through any troubles.
      <p>The second method is to practice conscious listening. This method involves; as it states, conscious listening to others and focusing all your attention on another individual without interruptions. In practicing this method, the benefits are the ability to truly understand and perceive the words that the individual are saying,
        and it also helps to free yourself from jumping to conclusions too quickly based on what the other individual discusses.</p>
      <p>The third method is to partake in journalling. This is a method that involves penning down whatever comes to mind without hesitation and is a good way of writing down ideas and in the process have a better understanding of how you function yourself.
        Having a better understanding of your self will prove benficial in the ways in which you communicate with others as well, as it may give you a better insight on how the other individual is also feeling.</p>
      </div>
      <h2><em>So why is EQ important?</em></h2><br>
    <div class="text">
      <p>Emotional intelligence is important not solely for the workplace or others, but is also beneficial for us individually. Although the factors are there that having a better EQ will help manage your situation in a workplace where you can communicate more effectively with others, EQ is more beneficial for the self.
        Whether there is a stressful day or a day that hasn't gone so well; having a better understanding of EQ will allow yourself to navigate through the many negative (or positive) emotions that may be present. It would allow you to recognize why the emotions are there and how best to manage them so they don't become overwhelming.
        In a workplace setting, this helps you to manage expectations and allows better coordination between yourself and other members to get on the same page. Having a stronger sense of listening to others and understanding what they actually talk about, rather than what you think is being interpreted will lead to a smoother workspace as well.</p>
      <p>In short, having a better understanding of EQ will allow for a much better and happier mental state.</p>
