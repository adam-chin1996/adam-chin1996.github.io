       <p>Three things I learned about my myself and my ego due to learning core:
         <ol>
           <li>The first thing is my hubris and desire to try and solve the problems myself or 
              look for solutions myself even when I'm stuck. I would often spend a lot of my time 
              trying to search for a solution rather than ask for help, which needs a bit of change, 
              as I move further into the course.
           </li>
           <li>
             The second thing is that flipped learning is more vastly difficult than I had anticipated,
             because initially, I liked the challenge of searching for my own answers, but as I 
             quickly realized that searching for answers blindly would be more difficult than guided 
             learning, I found it difficult to stay on track of the task at hand.
           </li>
           <li>
             The third thing I have learnt is that, more often than not; taking a break away from the 
             task, and setting my mind at ease helps a lot with troubleshooting. When I'm not actively 
             staring at the screen of the task, I am more able to come up with different posibilites I 
             could try to navigate the problem quicker, before turning to help, thus speeding up my own 
             learning process
           </li>
         </ol>
       </p>
       <p>
         The roles of values and empathy in this field are quite important as they often involve the 
         act of listening to one another and understanding each other in terms of how to go about 
         approaching a problem. This will probably be a more specific occurence when it comes to pair 
         coding, and so it's important to be able to value each other and empathise with others on their 
         own learning path which may be different to our own. As more tasks involve peer work, having a 
         better understanding, and having a self-awareness to values and empathy will help in a long way 
         when it comes to the communication aspect of programming.
       </p>
       <p>
         The thing that has surprised me the most about core learning is how useful it actually is, in 
         contrast to my initial thoughts where it would be helpful, but it's not the key part 
         associated with why I am taking the program. Core tasks and core learning has helped me better 
         to understand myself, understand my strengths and weaknesses, and helped me identify areas in 
         which I can improve upon. Reflection in particular has been quite the task that I'm most 
         engaged with, as building upon what I've learnt in the day, or trying to break down what i've 
         learned from the day through journalling has been very helpful in my overall learning process.
       </p>
       <p>
         The most challenging aspect of core learning was making a learning plan and trying to stick to it.
         Although, in hindsight, it is quite easy to make a learning plan that is quite realistic in the 
         approach, sometimes, things can just pop up or get in the way of learning. This can vary from 
         distractions, emergencies to just difficulties understanding the task challenges. Although there 
         are various tasks and methods to help de-stress the mind, or help to focus on the challenge ahead, 
         it can sometimes be hard to engage with the methods purely because of too much stress build-up that 
         trying to de-stress or relax just adds more stress. And lastly, although the core learnings were 
         there to help us be more empathetic and self-aware, I felt as though, I could not turn that inwardly 
         to be empathetic and kind to myself, and often times, I was not. It became quite difficult to build
         a mental habit to not fall back into that self-critical superego mode, and just accept my limitations.
       </p>
       <p>
         I think, despite my own personal difficulties with engaging in core learning, after having gone through 
         the weeks and building my own understanding of how core learning is designed to help us improve ourselves,
         I understand why it's something that's focused upon in this field. Although this technical 
         programme is mostly about the technical aspects and principles, having a strong sense of core learning 
         is also quite vital in the success of the learning. Though, it was difficult for me personally, I can still
         identify how it can be helpful for others to strike a balance between having an understanding of the 
         technical side of the programme and also having an understanding of the core learning. In short, a strong 
         understanding of the core learnings can also help engage in the technical learning where there are struggles,
         or if there are communication problems. Having the understanding, can help manage and navigate through the 
         workspace appropriately and possibly with less stress involved.
       </p>
       <p>
         Although I found myself struggling to properly utilise the core learning skills learned throughout each week,
         I would not say that having gone through the process of understanding eveyrthing has been a waste of time.
         There are still merits and benefits to having studied the core learning aspects, especially with a topic such 
         as neuroplsticity and growth mindset. I think that has been one of the more important topics to have looked 
         into, as that builds a foundational understanding on how we can better approach problem-solving. For the more
         personal health reasons factor; having had a study of the emotional intelligence aspect of core learning has 
         also been quite beneficial. Even if I had not managed to make the most use out of it, I think having gone 
         through the activity has helped me to better navigate through things than if I had not read through those tasks.
