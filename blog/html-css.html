        <h1>What is the difference between Fixed, Absolute and Relative positioning?</h1>
        </header>
          <p>Fixed positioning is a state where an image or object remains at a fixed position regardless of page scroll or mouse movement.</p>
          <p>If an image is set to fixed as a background image, it would mean that any overlaying properties such as text, links, media or images,</p>
          <p>that aren't also at a fixed position could slide over the top of the background. If an image is set to fixed at a certain location within the page,</p>
          <p>the image will not move from it's location and will always load there.</p>
          <p>Absolute positioning means that whatever contains the property of absolute will be ignored by other elements and will overlap them if they conflict with each other.</p> 
          <p>This can lead to the absolute element covering over other elements if placed improperly. Absolute positioning ignores the flow of the page and does it's own thing.</p>
          <p>Relative positioning is as it's name states, the element that contains the relative property will be added relative to whatever contains the element.</p>
          <p>If a relative positioned element has no containment field, it will default to being contained within the body of the page. Relative position is the most useful tag</p>
          <p>to apply to elements that want to be fixed, but still functions with the flow of the page.</p>
          <p>In short, the difference between the 3 positions is as follows:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Fixed: Object remains fixed regardless of page position and other elements.</li>
              <li>Absolute: Object is fixed at a position relative to page/element and ignores other elements - fixed outside of the page flow.</li>
              <li>Relative: Object is fixed within it's own specified field and doesn't interfere with everything else - remaining in the flow.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="relative">
              <p>The box here is relative positioned on the page decided by numerical values.</p>
            <div class="absolute">
              <p>The box which contains this text is "absolute positioned" within the parent box also decided by numerical values.</p></div>
              </div>
          <p>As we can see here, the background is stationary and doesn't move even when you scroll the page. This is because the background image has been assigned a fixed position.</p>
          <p>It's fixed position is to remain in the background, covering the entirety of the page where it won't overlap any other elements that are placed over the top.</p>
          <p>However, the relative positioned box is stationed relative on the page to whatever came before itself. If I wish to move the position of the relative box elsewhere,</p>
          <p>I would need to input numerical values to the "top, left, bottom and right" styling within css in order to move the element relative to its position.</p>
          <p>While the absolute box remains in the relative box, regardless of where I position the relative-box relative to the page, the box inside relative-box will remain at it's fixed location.</p>
          <p>This is what is meant by absolute value vs relative value. Relative positioning is more free-flowing, while absolute is more targetted.</p>
          <img class="code" src="../images/code-demonstration.JPG">
          <p>As the above image illustrates, as correlating to box position, the relative positioned box has a left numerical value of 350px(pixels),</p>
          <p>which means the box has been positioned 350pixels relative to the left of the page.</p>
          <p>Whilst the absolute box, despite only having a left numerical value of 10pixels, it does not position itself relative to the left of the page because it is absolutely contained within the relative box.</p>
          <p>As such, the absolute box only moved 10 pixels left from the parent box.</p>
