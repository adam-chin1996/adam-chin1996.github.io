      <h2>Neuroplasticity in a nutshell</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Understanding how neuroplasticity works is a great benefit to our own mindset, as it allows us
          to break free from the constraints of belief that we have a fixed mindset without growth. 
          Understanding the principles to neuroplasticity frees our mind from the doubts that we aren't able 
          to learn new things, but rather inspires us to think of the ways in which it can be beneficial in 
          helping us to learn new things. When we hear the term of fixed mindset, we're more likely to doubt 
          our own learning abilities and may hinder our process to building connections in our minds, 
          but when we are indoctrinated into the belief of neuroplasticity - the ability to learn from 
          constant malleability of our brain to absorb knowledge, then that in turn changes the person's 
          confidence and belief in learning things. Rather than to have a solid fixed mindset, it allows us 
          to view our learning habits in a growth mindset method, which greater boosts our ability to learn 
          new things and adapt to learning as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best ways to train neuroplasticity are the common methods and practices that are already 
          utilized in our daily lives whenever we want to train our minds or our bodies to get better at 
          something - a lot of practice, and the ability to build connections and understand how to improve 
          upon our learning capabilities to further mould our approach in the way we practice. An example of 
          daily practice is like bodybuilding. Whenever we train on a daily basis to improve our muscle growth, 
          we are constantly adapting our methods of improvement and bettering our methods of practice as we push 
          ourselves forward in our learning. This is exactly the same with neuroplasticity! The constant practice 
          of a task helps our brain to build connections and improve ourselves in that task. 
          Not only that, the constant can then also be further refined by building our understanding of the task - 
          building connections to what we are currently learning and to what we have already learnt. 
          Through this method, we're able to add onto our pre-exisitng knowledge and also increase our overall 
          understanding of the task and the methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the best way to increase our neuroplasticity isn't simply to keep learning new things, 
          but also to try and break down our task and understand what we are learning through repetition of the task. 
          If you want to get better at writing, constantly try to write something, and then refine that whenever possible. 
          The same applies to every other task. Learning without a purpose doesn't help to strengthen our mindset 
          nor does it build neuroplasticity within ourselves unless we can repeat the tasks several times over and 
          constantly refine it before moving on to trying to learn the next task at hand. 
          Through proper practice of repetition, this is the method in which we can engage with building a stronger 
          connection and understanding to the material and the task. As such, when learning about something new, breaking 
          the information down to something connected and relevant to what we already know is the best way to improve, 
          as we then already have a foundation for the knowledge in which to grow from, and build good neuroplastic pathways 
          from there onwards.
          Here is a good article to use as reference for understanding neuroplastic pathways and the methods in which to 
          improve cognitive learning and understanding.

        <h2>Growth mindset</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          So what is growth mindset then? Growth mindset entails the ability and desire to constantly improve and not remain 
          static towards challenges and obstacles. Through growth mindset is where our applied knowledge and belief of 
          neuroplasticity become intertwined. Whereas neuroplasticity builds upon the belief that we are able to constantly 
          learn and adapt, growth mindset is the notion of being able to take a challenge and viewing it as not a struggle 
          or a wall that hinders learning, but an opportunity to grow your knowledge on how to tackle such an obstacle. 
          This is especially applicable in the field of web development, as there are and will often be times where we hit 
          a brick wall and feel like giving up because the challenge feels overwhelmingly difficult; but with the idea of 
          growth mindset, we can restructure our thinking to that of positivity and look at the challenge as a way to improve 
          ourselves and learn to adapt to the challenges. In this method, it changes our perspective from "I can't do this" to 
          that of "how could I approach this differently to achieve the desired result?". 
          This change in mindset, in the way we pose questions to ourselves are the methods in which we can grow ourselves to 
          become better at problem solving and better at learning and understanding how to tackle obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something in this exercise that changed for me was when I read about how growth mindset enables us to adapt better, 
          and isn't about how "Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be 
          accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?...". [excerpt taken from 
          <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/"></a>] The thing that resonated with me the 
          most was how I felt towards a particular situation, especially given my current journey while learning and studying 
          about web development. Often times, the struggles that I face are not to do with hitting a brick wall and wanting to 
          give up, but rather, I discover the challenge, and I seek for a solution. The problem then lies in that I feel my own 
          intelligence is not great enough to comprehend the solution, in that I will often find myself going into a hole trying 
          to find a solution that matches with my own understanding, in a way which allows me to break the information down into 
          something that is relatable to my own pre-exisitng knowledge. Whenever I look at a challenge, I will always try to break 
          it down and try to understand how it works, and if I can't, I would often look for a solution and try to break those 
          down to understand how to go about the concept. However, too often at times, I run into walls where I constantly struggle 
          to break the information down into something palatable. It is not the immediate notion of wanting to give up, but the 
          constant struggles of the challenge in which the concept of neuroplasticity and the idea of growth mindset really begin 
          to be challenged. Questions such as "can I really do this? or "Am i able to learn?" come into question more often and not, 
          and it's the urge to fight back against those thoughts and trying to believe in oneself, that pushes me onwards. 
          In this case, the only major change that occured for me was to keep an open mind towards the obstacle and at least 
          persevere through the task.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking of perseverance, this will be the method in which I try to incorporate growth mindset into my learning. 
          Even if i'm not feeling smart enough to tackle the challenges, or feel like I'm capable for the task at hand, 
          I will still at the very least try and persevere through it. Through this, I'm hoping that regardless of my current intellect, 
          that at least with enough perseverance, I will be able to overcome the obstacles and achieve the results I desire. 
          (Or at least don't give into the mindset of feeling static, unable to learn and giving up.)
        </p>
        <p>
          There are quite a lot of resources out there that help to establish meaning of "fixed vs growth mindset, but an article that 
          resonated with me is <a href="[https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset]"></a> due solely to the fact that 
          having a growth mindset and the idea of neuroplasticity will help to improve and better oneself not only in terms of learning 
          and understanding, but also to become happier within oneself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way in which I can incorporate both my understanding of neuroplasticity and growth mindset to my listed learning plan 
          really stems from and begins with being kind to myself as I venture through the learning process. It's the idea of not giving up, 
          and believing and persevering through a task to try and understand it and not give up on the struggles. Especially given how 
          I tend to constantly look for solutions to a problem/challenge or obstacles, I think that having both the idea of growth and 
          neuroplasticity will help focus my drive into trying to find the solutions to the problems at hand (maybe).
