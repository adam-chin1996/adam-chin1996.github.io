      <h2>Methods to problem solving</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          A simple problem that occured for me, and is a consistent simple problem were syntax errors 
          that prevented the code from running properly and kept coming up with errors. It was through 
          this singular instance of coding error which lead to me discovering the process of coding 
          workflow where code runs from top down.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main problem solving method I employed for this situation was just to read error messages 
          to determine where the error in the code lay. Furthermore, from this encounter, I created my 
          own systems in place to double check errors in the code with assistance from error messages.
          The system involved firstly checking for typos and other syntax/wording errors, before secondly 
          checking the actual code itself to make sure that the code format and what I wanted to achieve was 
          written correctly. Lastly, I would check for any reference errors - errors where I'm not referencing 
          parameters or objects/arrays correctly, as proper referencing is something that sometimes trips me up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt like throughout this problem solving method, I came to understand more about how pieces of 
          code are put together and why they are put together the way they are - referring back to code workflow.
          It also became slightly more clearer about where I'm writing certain functions and how they connect and 
          also refer back to a previous function (if it were written later) properly in order to maintain 
          code functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt that code workflow is very important. As even if you could write code properly later down the 
          workflow, if a previous code doesn't function, or if there are errors preventing it from working properly, 
          then it messes up the overall functionality of the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more complex problem I encountered was figuring out how to loop properly through objects and arrays in 
          particular in order to complete the challenges presented ahead of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the more complex nature of the problem, I had to rely on many more problem solving methods in order 
          to understand how to utilise the specific properties and elements of a function to solve an issue. 
          The numerous problem solving methods I went through included first and foremost - googling, as the most basic 
          principle in trying to figure out the solution. After reading through many articles and watching many youtube 
          based videos to help gauge my understanding of the problem, I would then turn to breaking the problem down 
          into smaller problems and utilise the rubber ducky method to try and figure out why that specific part of the 
          code was not working as intended. Lastly, I would resort to asking my peers to see if they could see what the 
          problem with the code was and where my errors lay. Best case scenario usually involved discovering more 
          articles to read up on and learning new things before finally stumbling onto a solution of some kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process of working my way through a more complex problem-solving method felt quite frustrating at times 
          because it often felt like I wasn't getting anywhere with the problem-solving. Especially given that I had my 
          own flowchart of how to break down a problem, sometimes it felt like there was always something missing - something 
          that I wasn't getting that completely broke down the structure of my code and I would spend too long on a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something that I learned while going through this process involved two different outcomes. The first being that I 
          shouldn't spend too long feeling stuck and frustrated on a problem and turn to help much sooner. The second discovery 
          being that usually, things become more clear and I figure out more solutions when I turn away from the problem for a 
          while and do something else. The second discovery in particular is quite an interesting discovery because there had 
          been 2 other instances where I was deeply struggling with a problem, but after having taken a break and thought about
          it within my subconscious, I was able to come up with a solution after taking some time away. The main takeaway is 
          that sometimes, it's better to leave a problem to sit for a while, and come back to it after with a different perspective.
          It's much more helpful than I initially anticipated.
        </p>
        <p>
          In regards to the problem solving methods, I feel like pseudocode can be quite helpful, but i still need practice of 
          writing pseudocode in order to fully understand how to utilise it for its benefits.
          Just trying something, on the other hand usually leads to failure, so it's not a method that I'm all too comfortable 
          in using at the moment.
          Rubber ducky method has been one of my primary go-to methods and especially solitude in isolation, I have to freedom 
          to just talk the problem out to a brick wall.
          Reading error messages has been helpful and was what initially led to me creating my own set of problem-solving charts.
          However, I'm not all too confident in understanding how to read error messages properly, as sometimes, the error messages 
          throw me off from what the actual problems could be, and the error message could be completely unrelated to the main 
          problem itself.
          Console.logging has been surprisingly more useful than I initially thought. It allows me to figure out - in terms of 
          problem solving - to understand what I'm working with, and what code may be required to solve the issue. I feel more 
          confident in the use of this method, as the initial method to be used when dealing with unknowns.
          Googling is a no brainer; it is the most commonly used method employed when searching for solutions.
          Asking peers for help is the last resort sort of step when it comes to problem solving. It is one that I don't necessarily 
          turn to early on, or early enough on a problem, but is one I hope to be able to use more often in times of problems.
          Asking coaches is something that I don't employ and thus have the least confidence in using. it's also something I'm quite 
          hesitant to use at present stage.
          Lastly, reflection as a whole has been my most used form of problem-solving as usually writing things out in a journal and 
          using images and charts to help break down my understanding of what the code itself is doing. This is often accompanied by
          reviewing over code that I have learnt and written to strengthen my overall learning capabilities.
