    <h2>Woah! You're back here for a run-down of Javascript and DOM!</h2><br>
    <div class="text">
      <p>So, what is Javascript? And why does it matter in relation to HTML and CSS? Well, a simple analogy that can describe what javascript is; in relation to our theatrical analogies - javascript is the action to our html script. Or to put it more precisely, it is a set of actions within a tasklist to make the script run nice and smoothly.
        Am I still talking about theatre? Why yes I am, and the similarities to how theatre functions in relation to how handling a javascript code is almost fundamentally the same. If HTML is our theatrical script, and CSS is our line emphasis (our styling), then it's clear that in order to build a performance, we must add the actions to the script.
        In theatre, the continous set of actions lead into the next action until each act of a performance is complete. This is the same with how a javascript runs, in which the actions that we set are denoted as functions, and those functions run through various other functions until it completes it's set of actions for an act. This can be a loop, but more on that later.
      </p>
      <p>---------</p>
      <p>So first, let's explain the basics of Javascript and control flow. Control flow is the tasklist that manages the operations in how Javascript code is run. Put simply, the tasklist keeps track of what operations are being done, and it runs through the code in sequential order from top to bottom much like a tasklist, after all, you don't start a tasklist with the last task.
        So then what are loops? Well, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results - except we subtract the insanity part, because the process of doing the same thing over and over is given to the computer. They key difference here lies in the fact that depending on the functions we give our code, we can loop continously specifically in order to search for a different result.
        Within these loops, we can add true or false statements for the computer to run against, and we can also designate a desired amount of times for the process to loop, and also what function to loop. It's very important that we correctly set a desired amount of loops, and that the function is able to resolve itself, otherwise we may end up with something known as recursive code. This is for another time though.
      </p>
      <p>---------</p>
      <p>How do we express and apply a loop to a function? Well, first; we must express a function that would require a loop to exist. The most general case loop function is the need to search for something by itself, something in an array, or an object within an array. So how do we start? Well, the loop is 'for' something right? So we would begin by expressing 'for()' with a parameter. (Hint: this is a parameter! It's the brackets).
        Within the parameter, the most common 'for' loop goes like so: (let i = 0; i < (insert condition); i++). What does this mean? Let's break it down! The value of 'i' is equivalent to the index and it usually starts at 0, but you can also set the start position to when you want the function to run from. But what is an index? Imagine a numerical chart with all the numbers on it. This is the index - except instead of starting at 1, we start at 0.
        Okay, so now we know what the index is, the value (i = 0) basically 'lets' us tell the computer to run a function that begins at the index position of 0. We can swap '0' out for any 'x' number, and it would tell the computer to run from 'x' position on the index! Got it? Great! Next, we have the condition segment of the loop function in (i < (insert condition)).
        If i = index, what's the condition? Well, we want to set the condition of how many loops we desire! Do we want to loop once, twice, greater than 10 times, less than 100 times? The amount of times we wish for the function to loop is the value we place in the condition. However; there are situations where we don't necessarily want to express a value amount to loop, but rather to loop until it reaches the end of a function. In order to express this,
        we would apply (array.length) as the condition to denote that we wish to loop until the end of the total length of the array. Are you still following along? Awesome! The last part of the loop is pretty simple. We have expressed already that we want to start the loop at index value of 'x' number, and we've told it to loop for an 'x' amount of times, but how do we actually tell it to loop.
        This is where we finish the expression with an (i++). This essentially tells the function to increase the integer inside the loop so we will go through the entire process of looping from beginning 'x' value to end 'x' value, or until the end of the (array.length). This expression loops upwards, so if we want to loop backwards, we would use (i--). It's simple '+' and '-' syntaxes all over again.
      </p>
      <p>--------</p>
      <p>What's the differences between an object and an array? Well, when we wish to extract data from somewhere, this 'somewhere' is usually inside in an array. Think of an array as a box that contains all our objects. When we search for something in an array, we can pull out an entire list of what that specific box contains and pick the data required out of the box. However, when we try to access data from an object, we only get the values associated with that particular selected object,
        and that object alone. We don't get to see the values of other objects alongside our selected object that are also present in the array. 
      </p>
      <p>--------</p>
      <p>Then what are functions? Well, you may be able to pick up on it already, but functions are basically the backbone in telling the computer what to do. There are two crucial parts to how a function works, and many many steps in between which tell a function what to do, but we'll begin with declaring a function. As its namesake, declaring a function is exactly that - we say what the function is and what it will do through writing 'function functionNAME()' with parameters.
        Within these functions, we can assign many properties and tell it to do a whole lot of tasks that in which it completes in seconds. But of course, we can tell it to do a whole lot of tasks, but how do we tell it to spew out the findings after it's completed its task? Well, what do you do when you want to ask someone for something? Exactly! you call them! And this is exactly what we do with our function. This is the other crucial part to a function,
        we call for them with the expression functionName() with the parameters. Notice how we don't need to write the word 'function' when we call for the function? This is because writing a function declares it, while calling the function only calls the name of the function. Also; I lied, there's technically a third crucial part of the function, and that is to tell the function what to do itself. After all, a function can't run unless you tell it what to do.
      </p>
      <p>--------</p>
      <p>Lastly, what is the DOM and why does that matter? And why did you leave the DOM til last? Well, put simply; DOM or (Document Object Model) is the application for accessing and reviewing the documental webpage of a site. This blog itself is written on a document that can be accessed within the DOM.
        The DOM itself allows us to see how a page will function with our coding, and it allows us to see how javascript can interact with HTML and CSS classes too. Through this method, DOM manipulation allows us to change every element within a page to suit certain needs. We can alter a page's CSS stylesheet, change the text that is written on a page, or even alter the functions within a javascript file through the DOM. However, any changes made through the DOM are temporary,
        as the changes revert back upon site refresh. BUT! If we load our own local html file project onto the local session of a browser through the DOM, we can enable the DOM to act as a text editor, wherein because we have permissions granted from the local side; we can make permanent alterations to the DOM that would be reflected on our local file afterwards. Usage of DOM is quite useful, as it allows you to test your site on a local server,
        prior to sending the document out into the global server, and notice if there are any errors or warnings associated with the page code in question. Okay great, so we know what we can do with the DOM, but what exactly is it?
      </p>
      <p>DOM is a window into the digital document. Within the window lies the document also known as the html file that all the displayed data is written upon. Adjacent to the document file contains eventHistory files, img srcs files, navigation files and a plethora of other files that all work in conjunction to make a site run smoothly. Within each of those individual files are additional elements broken down to express what that particular file contains in itself. For example;
        in a document file, we would find that there are elements that we are familiar with that are broken down and expressed individually such as the "head" or a "body" of a text document. Those elements are further broken down into elements contained within them, such as "titles" and "title-text" found within the "head" element, and "img srcs", "anchors" or even "p" tags expressed inside. Think of the DOM as a family tree where the window is the default ancestor,
        and the documents, navigation and eventHistory are the parents of the individual child elements deeper inside. It may sound complicated to understand, but the take away from learning about DOM is that it gives you free manipulation of the elements within a site without making permanent changes to the site itself, unless we use the prior aforementioned example of loading a local file into the local session of a browser.
