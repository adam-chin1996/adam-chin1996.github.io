    <h2>Woah! You're back here for a rundown of Javascript and DOM</h2><br>
    <div class="text">
      <p>So, what is Javascript? And why does it matter in relation to HTML and CSS? Well, a simple analogy that can describe what javascript is; inrelation to our theatrical analogies - javascript is the action to our html script. Or to put it more precisely, it is a set of actions within a tasklist to make the script run nice and smoothly.
        Am I still talking about theatre? Why yes I am, and the similarities to how theatre functions in relation to how handling a javascript code is almost fundamentally the same. If HTML is our theatrical script, and CSS is our line emphasis (our styling), then it's clear that in order to build a performance, we must add the actions to the script.
        In theatre, the continous set of actions lead into the next action until each act of a performance is complete. This is the same with how a javascript runs, in which the actions that we set are denoted as functions, and those functions run through various other functions until it completes it's set of actions for an act. This can be a loop, but more on that later.
