        <p>My core personal values and Identity:</p>
        <p>It's hard to determine what a situation I've experienced that required an ethical decision to be made. In hindsight, there probably were some moments that required me to make a decision, but I've always followed through on my own principles of having empathy and understanding for others. If there were a situation in which I have the confidence to give an answer or be able to support in, then I would naturally give my best shot at helping. However, for the most part, I tend to keep to myself more often than not, which may have led to missed opportunities, but can also mean that I have neither made the situation better or worse. A neutral state is something that I'm most comfortable residing in.</p>
        <p>I think one thing that stands out uniquely for myself is my understanding of the different cultures that i've experienced and the clash of differing values between them. From a personal perspective, there is a notion of self-importance in my family, where the values of self takes priority over others, but being surrounded by others as I grew up, I leaned more towards the idea of being selfless and putting others before self. It has been, and still remains a tricky balance between the two values to maintain.</p>
        <p>A strength of mine that I value quite heavily is my ability to express myself through words, which is ironic given my closed-off introverted nature. However, my aptitute and attitude towards learning and discussion has always been something I'm confident in, provided the space in which I share and communicate within feels comfortable for me to be open. The limitation to this is that I generally close myself off because there's nothing additional to which I wish to add from what others have stated, or I don't feel confident in sharing what i know or what i've learnt. Confidence and comfortability are the aspects that I stuggle most when surrounded by peers, however, if someone were to directly ask me for something, then I would try my best to give a reasonable answer to the query.</p>
        <p>A single example would be my ability to express my words through a text document where I am able to be more thoughtful about certain things.</p>
