        <p>My core personal values and Identity:</p>
        <p>It's hard to determine what a situation I've experienced that required an ethical decision to be made. In hindsight, there probably were some moments that required me to make a decision, but I've always followed through on my own principles of having empathy and understanding for others. If there were a situation in which I have the confidence to give an answer or be able to support in, then I would naturally give my best shot at helping. However, for the most part, I tend to keep to myself more often than not, which may have led to missed opportunities, but can also mean that I have neither made the situation better or worse. A neutral state is something that I'm most comfortable residing in.</p>
        <p>I think one thing that stands out uniquely for myself is my understanding of the different cultures that i've experienced and the clash of differing values between them. From a personal perspective, there is a notion of self-importance in my family, where the values of self takes priority over others, but being surrounded by others as I grew up, I leaned more towards the idea of being selfless and putting others before self. It has been, and still remains a tricky balance between the two values to maintain.</p>
        <p>A strength of mine that I value quite heavily is my ability to express myself through words, which is ironic given my closed-off introverted nature. However, my aptitute and attitude towards learning and discussion has always been something I'm confident in, provided the space in which I share and communicate within feels comfortable for me to be open. The limitation to this is that I generally close myself off because there's nothing additional to which I wish to add from what others have stated, or I don't feel confident in sharing what i know or what i've learnt. Confidence and comfortability are the aspects that I stuggle most when surrounded by peers, however, if someone were to directly ask me for something, then I would try my best to give a reasonable answer to the query.</p>
        <p>A single example would be my ability to express my words through a text document where I am able to be more thoughtful about certain things.</p>
        <p>Another strength of mine that can sometimes be a burden is my persistence. If something doesn't work out or something goes wrong, or perhaps even when i'm struggling through certain aspects of my work-life balance, i will tend to persevere through the struggles. Although this may be a good motivational strength to have, it can also be a burden as it's difficult for me to let go of things until I feel I have completed an activity to a satisfactory level. However, being able to persevere through the difficulties of some tasks will surely help me be able to navigate through the the overall learning objective.</p>
        <p>Once again, due to my personal identity of being quite solo-determined, problems that may occur when working with others is not necessarily a problem for me. If there are struggles that others have that I can assist with, I would surely help out, but otherwise, I would go off to complete my tasks at hand and then communicate with what the other problems may be. With my background being that of a theatre student and having had an understanding with working alongside others, it is natural that there are problems to be had, and the best way around it is to break a problem up into small piece where different members can cover up weaknesses that individuals may have. It is normally the best way to solve a problem and makes things less stressful</p>
        <p>An added note to the previous point is that it "normally" is better to split it up. However, I always have that desire to take the burden upon myself so as to be selfless and only have the problem affect me. It's not a great mentality to have, and it's the biggest struggle that I have in terms of my own identity. Kindness given to others is much easier than kindness given to self.</p>
