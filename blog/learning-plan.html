        <h2>My learning plan!</h2>
          <div class="text">
            <p>For the meantime, as things are getting started, it would be difficult to determine exactly what my long term goal will be. As a starting mark, I think my long term goal should be to just continually improve and keep learning as I go along, and get better at understanding the concepts behind webdev.</p>
            <p>One of my strengths in learning is that i generally try to find a solution to a problem I don't understand, or search for supplemental material to what I have been learning. A limitation to this is that sometimes, even with the additional material, it may still become difficult to understand because i'm not sure how to break down the problem into something digestable. When I'm unable to figure out why something works, I end up diving too deep into searching for solutions that I may forgo other activities. This could hinder my overall learning capabilities as I end up sticking to one problem for far too long.</p>
            <p>A skill that I'd like to see develop for myself is, at present, difficult to decide. As a natural introvert, it would be a common goal to be able to develop my communication skills with others, but that goal in itself would be difficult to achieve due to how it would require a change in my core personality.</p>
            <p>A very important commitment I need to make to myself is to be kind to myself and not dwell too much on the struggles. It will be a challenge due to my natural tendencies of wanting to compare myself to others, but first and foremost, I need to remember that I am learning everything through my own pace. A good way to manage my commitment is to remember to set goals at the beginning of the day and evaluate whether I met my goals at the end, where I went wrong and what I could've done to improve. One of the problems that constantly keeps popping up is the notion of spending too much time on a particular topic and not being able to commit to the suggested timebox timeframe.</p>
            <p>A method in which to manage my expectations for this course is to take a breather every once in a while whenever I feel like i'm spending too much time on a topic. It may be easier to understand something after I've walked away from it for a bit.</p>
            <p>An approach to how I will seek help will be lengthy. It is, in a sense, one part hubris and one part shame. The hubris side of me will always determine to look for a solution that doesn't directly involve asking others, which is commonly associated with the shame felt for not being able to understand it, or being able to express my problem accurately. As such, despite the problems that may occur, asking around in the cohort will always be a last resort rather than a first.</p></li>
            <p>Expectations of the facilitations team is a unique question. The expectations would be the support given, but going back to a previous point where I struggle to communicate my problems, it may be difficult to reach out for such support.</p>
            <p>As for the scheduling information, I guess it would be important for me to set not only daily goals, but also a weekly goal, so that I would be able to complete through the tasks within a reasonable timeframe as to allow the study portion of my week to not conflict with any other obligations that may pop up.</p>
