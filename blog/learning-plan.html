            <ul>
              <li><p>For the meantime, as things are getting started, it would be difficult to determine exactly what my long term goal will be. 
                As a starting mark, I think my long term goal should be to just continually improve and keep learning as I go along, and get better at understanding the concepts behind webdev.</p></li>
              <li><p>One of my strengths in learning is that i generally try to find a solution to a problem I don't understand, or search for supplemental material to what I have been learning.
                A limitation to this is that sometimes, even with the additional material, it may still become difficult to understand because i'm not sure how to break down the problem into something digestable.
                When I'm unable to figure out why something works, I end up diving too deep into searching for solutions that I may forgo other activities. This could hinder my overall learning capabilities as I end up sticking to one problem for far too long.</p></li>
              <li><p>A skill that I'd like to see develop for myself is, at present, difficult to decide. As a natural introvert, it would be a common goal to be able to develop my communication skills with others, but that goal in itself would be difficult to achieve due to how it would require a change in my core personality.</p></li>
