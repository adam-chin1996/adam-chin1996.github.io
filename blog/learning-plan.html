          <h2>My learning plan!</h2>
            <div class="text">
              <p>
                For the meantime, as things are getting started, it would be difficult to determine 
                exactly what my long term goal will be. As a starting mark, I think my long term goal 
                should be to just continually improve and keep learning as I go along, and get better 
                at understanding the concepts behind webdev.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of my strengths in learning is that i generally try to find a solution to a problem 
                I don't understand, or search for supplemental material to what I have been learning. 
                A limitation to this is that sometimes, even with the additional material, it may still 
                become difficult to understand because i'm not sure how to break down the problem into 
                something digestable. When I'm unable to figure out why something works, I end up diving 
                too deep into searching for solutions that I may forgo other activities. 
                This could hinder my overall learning capabilities as I end up sticking to one problem 
                for far too long.
              </p>
              <p>
                A skill that I'd like to see develop for myself is, at present, difficult to decide. 
                As a natural introvert, it would be a common goal to be able to develop my communication 
                skills with others, but that goal in itself would be difficult to achieve due to how it 
                would require a change in my core personality.
              </p>
              <p>
                A very important commitment I need to make to myself is to be kind to myself and not dwell 
                too much on the struggles. It will be a challenge due to my natural tendencies of wanting 
                to compare myself to others, but first and foremost, I need to remember that I am learning 
                everything through my own pace. A good way to manage my commitment is to remember to set 
                goals at the beginning of the day and evaluate whether I met my goals at the end, where I 
                went wrong and what I could've done to improve. One of the problems that constantly keeps 
                popping up is the notion of spending too much time on a particular topic and not being 
                able to commit to the suggested timebox timeframe.
              </p>
              <p>
                A method in which to manage my expectations for this course is to take a breather every 
                once in a while whenever I feel like i'm spending too much time on a topic. It may be 
                easier to understand something after I've walked away from it for a bit.
              </p>
              <p>
                An approach to how I will seek help will be lengthy. It is, in a sense, one part hubris 
                and one part shame. The hubris side of me will always determine to look for a solution 
                that doesn't directly involve asking others, which is commonly associated with the shame 
                felt for not being able to understand it, or being able to express my problem accurately. 
                As such, despite the problems that may occur, asking around in the cohort will always be 
                a last resort rather than a first.
              </p>
              <p>
                Expectations of the facilitations team is a unique question. The expectations would be 
                the support given, but going back to a previous point where I struggle to communicate my 
                problems, it may be difficult to reach out for such support.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for the scheduling information, I guess it would be important for me to set not only 
                daily goals, but also a weekly goal, so that I would be able to complete through the tasks 
                within a reasonable timeframe as to allow the study portion of my week to not conflict with 
                any other obligations that may pop up.

          <h2>My bootcamp learning plan!</h2>
            <div class="text">
              <p>
                My long term goal/career pathway has definitely slightly altered since the start of foundations.
                I feel like I'm starting to understand my strengths a bit, and know what I'm capable of, and
                though there are certain options and fields I could venture into, I think my goal is to work 
                towards being a fullstack developer as a career path. Although, I feel that I am more 
                confident in the front-end in terms of html/css styling than javascript, I think that for a 
                personal goal, I should try to get better at both, as it feels more enriching and satisfying 
                when I'm able to combine the languages to make one cohesive product. Although I'm not entirely 
                sure on where I want to end up after I graduate, I do know that whereever I do go, I want to be 
                able to utilise the knowledge I've gained to help and improve quality of life.
              </p>
              <p>
                My strengths and weaknesses outlined in foundations have now changed, in an almost drastic fashion.
                Where my strength lay prior when it came to finding solutions by myself, have now become a limitation 
                of sorts where there is quite a struggle in trying to interpret the language of javascript and such, 
                and understanding/breaking the material down in a way that benefits my learning. Foresight had me 
                outline that although it was a strength, it could prove to hinder my overall learning capabilities if 
                I stayed stuck on a problem for far too long. This ended up proving to be true during foundations, and; 
                so to rectify that error, I think I will have to reach out much quicker for help when necessary and not 
                shy away from the problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Again, on review of my previous foundations learning plan, I think the biggest challenge during bootcamp 
                that is a non-technical skill which still remains; is my hesitancy to seek for help and thus, my lack of 
                communication skills. I think this problem, combined with the fact that being too stuck on a problem will 
                lead to falling behind and not being able to keep up with work will be a serious problem that needs to be 
                reviewed. I think, the biggest change between now and bootcamp is the need to speak up and ask for help 
                when I'm stuck, and not feel ashamed for not being able to understand the problem. If this issue can be 
                overcome; although it won't entirely solve my problems of keeping up with work, I feel it should at least 
                lessen the stress I have when it comes to managing the workload during bootcamp.
              </p>
              <p>
                A non-technical skill to continue to be developed would naturally be my communication situation. 
                Communication can tie into many other areas as well, including how to accurately give and respond to feedback, 
                and also being able to reflect better upon the work that's been created. I think that improving my 
                communication methods overall can also lead to building some better leadership skills as well. 
                Whatever the case may be, communication is quite a big factor in many aspects of this field, and also 
                everyday life, so I think being able to build upon the communication issue is probably the biggest key 
                take away from this lesson.
              </p>
              <p>
                Expectations from the bootcamp team, is not that different from what I had outlined previously. 
                In regards to communication, I guess I would expect myself to ask more questions and in response, see more 
                replies from the team so that I can manage my workload better. There is also the importance of creating a 
                sense of safety and encouragement, because often times, regardless of the problem's difficulty, 
                or the progress that's been made, there is a sense of discomfort when I have to ask questions or ask for help.
              </p>
              <p>
                The foundations plan was not so clear-cut and concise, so it proved a bit of a struggle to successfully 
                navigate through the problems I had in a timely manner. However, after examining and studying through the 
                core learning plans and the ideas that were presented during that time, I think the plan that I have now 
                constructed will be more beneficial in aiding my learning during bootcamp. My newly constructed learning plan 
                will include managing my struggles so I'm not too overwhelmed by them, looking for resources that can 
                potentially aid me in solving my problem, walking away for a bit of time to reset if I'm still finding 
                difficulties with the learning. And lastly, the biggest commitment that I do want to try and stick to is to 
                reach out for help sooner rather than later; whether that is communicating with my peers, or communicating with 
                the bootcamp team, whatever the case may be, I need to be able to seek for help when I need it. Coupled with this, 
                the other most important thing to manage, (assuming I've followed througn the learning plan), is to manage the 
                workload so that I'm not struggling to catch up. I have found that if I let a problem pester, one thing leads to
                another and I end up with a cascading problem where the problems start to stack on top of one another, and I end 
                up falling behind. I need to be able to solve my problems quickly, so I can move on quicker, for the sake of my 
                own personal learning, but also for my own mental health as well, which would lead to less stress when it comes 
                to dealing with the workflow.
